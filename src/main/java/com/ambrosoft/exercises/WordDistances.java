public class WordDistances {
    // shortest distance between occurrences of given 2 words: x & y
    // both have to exist in text; should be x != y
    // brute force: scan text from left to right, note consecutive positions, keep running min
    // indexing approach: for each word store list of positions which will be a sorted array
    // problem reduces to finding the closest pair of integers between 2 arrays
